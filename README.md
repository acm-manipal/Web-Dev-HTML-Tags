# Web-Dev-HTML-Tags
This Repository will be used to understand the basics of HTML tags.

For naming conventions of different sections, tags, classes, IDs, refer <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp">w3schools, </a><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/naming-html-files-3466503">thoughtco</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Beginner_tutorials/Underscores_in_class_and_ID_Names">mozilla docs</a>

To start with, refer <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html">w3schools</a> for basic syntax.

It's always better to divide an HTML page into different sections using div tags and by assigning each with a unique id.

Task -
1. Use basic tags like headings, paragraphs, dividers, title, body, etc.
2. To implement ordered lists and unordered lists.
3. Use image tags
4. Make a Table with at least 3 thead tags, and a tbody which has values as "table data (td)" elements within "table row (tr)" tags
